Smartthings Device Handler for McLighting v2 
https://github.com/toblum/McLighting

I just wanted something quick and dirty to be able to control my light strips with Google Assistant so this just uses the basic HTTP command API (no json).  There's no true feedback or polling so changes on the webBrowser don't get reflected here.  All the internal commands are available in webCore so you can do more advanced stuff in there.

This device handler can turn on/off the lights, set any color, set the brightness, change the scene, set the animation speed, and the ability to save and call all of the above with 6 different presets.
